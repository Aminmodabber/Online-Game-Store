3. What we did well
--------------------
We made a nice looking web app that is functional and easy to use.

4. Struggles
------------
We run a bit out of time which prevented us from proper testing and improving the quality of our code. For example css is in our base template which would have been better to have it in separate style.css file also javascript is in our templates. And we would have wanted to focus more on permissions and use 403 page where as now in many cases we just redirect to index page when user has no permissions. We didn't have time to fiqure out why in heroku our static file are not loaded properly.
